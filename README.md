With the cut backs being made by local government, schools and local councils, the availability of school transport is reducing.  
The schoolus project aims to create a platform for parents to crowd-source the things needed to source their own school transport:

- More parents / children so that the bus is full
- Bus companies to provide suitable transport
- A simple payment and legal framework to ensure the bus company is paid on time and that the company is reputable, legal and insured

This project is built using the MEAN stack and is a work in progress. It would be great to hear from anyone who would love to bring this to fruition.
